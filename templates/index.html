    <h3>How did I make this?</h3>
    <p>
      I started by searching for a dataset of individual burritos with supporting data. Luckily kaggle had <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/srcole/burritos-in-san-diego">this dataset</a>, which suited nicely, despite the limitation to burritos in San Diego. I then used K-Nearest Neighbors to cluster the burritos by price and ingredients (represented as a one hot encoded 1d vector). Clusters of 7 burritos are then displayed. The webapp runs on Flask for routing and forms, Pandas to manipulate data, and SciKit-Learn for finding clusters.

      Why did I make this?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two of my great passions in life are Data Science and Mexican Cuisine. The Bay Area's reputation for quality taqueria's was a signifiant motivator for my move out west. It was only natural that I've blended the two interests here.

      I hope it serves you well next time you're in San Diego, and stay tuned for expansions into Northern California.
